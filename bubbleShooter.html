        <div class="card-body">
          There’s more than one way to score a lot of points. With a few tips, getting combinations and racking in the
          points will shoot you up the ladder while you get past hard levels. With a little practice and focus on the
          basics, you can start from the easiest levels of the Bubble Shooter game and make it to the harder episodes.

            <h2>Be Quick and Decisive</h2>
            <p>Clear all the bubbles on this easy bubble shooter game so that you can move on to the next level quickly.
              Over time, you will naturally become quicker so no need to push yourself with this tip alone. A great way
              to increase your speed is by practicing on the big screen. This is one of the best PC games for beginners
              since you can use a mouse, which is more accurate. When you play on a PC, you get the experience of doing
              it without any downloads.</p>

            <h2>Be Smart When Shooting the Bubble</h2>
            <p>Make sure you plan your aim well so that it lands exactly where you want it to. If you accidentally block
              bubbles early in the game, you may make it more difficult to clear the playing field. When you’re playing
              on the web version, aim your cursor exactly where you want the bubble to go. This will make your shot more
              accurate and less likely to hit an unintended bubble.</p>

            <h2>Make A Clear Path</h2>
            <p>This is probably one of the most important tips for beating this easy bubble shooter game. If there are
              smaller groups of bubbles, don’t worry about them since you can get them later. Go for the grouped set of
              bubbles first so that you can drop the smaller groups of bubbles. In some of the higher levels, try to
              make a straight path to the big group of bubbles that may be hidden by smaller groups</p>

            <h2>Plan Your Bubble Colors Well</h2>
            <p>You can see what color bubble will be next to shoot which is part of why this is among the best PC games
              for beginners. Use this foresight to your advantage and plan ahead so that you can save time. If you have
              two colored bubbles in a row, you can target a single bubble by itself to clear the path. Making these
              combos will allow you to clear up “difficulty bubbles.”</p>
